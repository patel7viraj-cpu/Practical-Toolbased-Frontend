## 🖼 Task 2: Add an Image with Alt Text

Task 2 focuses on using *HTML and CSS* to display an image with proper formatting. You create **task2.html** with an **<h2>** heading ("My Favorite Place"), an **<img>** tag (using **src** and **alt** attributes), and a descriptive **<p>** below it. Using CSS, you must set the image width to **300px**, center the image on the page, and add a **20px** top margin to the paragraph for layout.









## 🔐 Task 8: Simple Login Form Layout

Task 8 is about building a frontend-only basic login form using *HTML and CSS*. You create **task8.html** and add a **<form>** element containing two sets of **<label>** and **<input>** fields (one for **Username** and one for **Password** with **type="password"**), and a **Login** button. CSS is used to style the form by centering it, adding a light border, padding inside, and margin-bottom between the inputs for a clean layout.
